# 🔒🚀 Security & Performance Monitor Setup

## Overview
This workflow provides automated security scanning and performance monitoring for your Smart Dashboard project.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Enable the Workflow
The workflow is now active and will run:
- ✅ On every push to `main` or `develop` branches
- ✅ On pull requests to `main` or `develop` branches  
- ✅ Daily at 2 AM UTC (scheduled security audit)
- ✅ Manually via GitHub Actions tab

### 2. Optional: Setup Snyk Integration
For enhanced security scanning, you can add Snyk:

1. Go to [snyk.io](https://snyk.io) and create a free account
2. Generate an API token from your account settings
3. In your GitHub repository:
   - Go to Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `SNYK_TOKEN`
   - Value: Your Snyk API token

### 3. What Gets Monitored

#### 🔒 Security Checks:
- **npm audit**: Scans for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Snyk scan**: Advanced vulnerability detection (if token provided)
- **Secret detection**: Scans code for accidentally committed secrets
- **SARIF upload**: Results appear in GitHub Security tab

#### 🚀 Performance Monitoring:
- **Lighthouse CI**: Web performance audit
- **Core Web Vitals**: LCP, FID, CLS measurements
- **Accessibility**: A11y compliance checking
- **SEO**: Search engine optimization analysis
- **Performance budgets**: Automated performance regression detection

## 📊 Results & Reports

### Where to Find Results:
1. **GitHub Actions tab**: View detailed logs
2. **Security tab**: Vulnerability reports and advisories
3. **Artifacts**: Download detailed performance reports
4. **Job summaries**: Quick overview in workflow runs

### Performance Thresholds:
- 🎯 Performance Score: ≥ 70%
- 🎯 Accessibility: ≥ 80%
- 🎯 Best Practices: ≥ 80%
- 🎯 SEO: ≥ 70%
- ⚡ First Contentful Paint: ≤ 3000ms
- ⚡ Largest Contentful Paint: ≤ 4000ms
- 📏 Cumulative Layout Shift: ≤ 0.15

## 🚨 When Alerts Trigger

### Security Issues:
- High or critical vulnerabilities found
- Secrets detected in code
- npm audit failures

### Performance Issues:
- Performance scores below thresholds
- Core Web Vitals failures
- Accessibility issues

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **No package.json**: The workflow handles projects without Node.js gracefully
2. **Server startup fails**: The workflow will try both `dist/` and root directory
3. **Snyk fails**: This is optional and won't fail the entire workflow
4. **Performance tests timeout**: Server readiness check has 30-second timeout

### Manual Testing:
```bash
# Test your site locally with Lighthouse
npm install -g @lhci/cli serve
serve . -l 3000
lhci autorun --collect.url=http://localhost:3000
```

## 📈 Optimization Tips

### Improve Security:
1. Keep dependencies updated
2. Use dependency lock files
3. Regular security audits
4. Follow secure coding practices

### Improve Performance:
1. Optimize images and assets
2. Minimize JavaScript and CSS
3. Use efficient loading strategies
4. Implement caching
5. Follow Core Web Vitals best practices
